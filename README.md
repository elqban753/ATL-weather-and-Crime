# Group-6-Project-1

This project used two datasets : 
  1. Weather of Atlanta in January 1st 2016 to December 31st 2016.
  2. Crime occurence in different locations in Atlanta from January 1st 2016 to December 31st 2016.

We would like to ask following questions using these datasets :
  1. Do certain weather conditions influence the volume of offenses in Atlanta, GA?
  2. Do certain weather conditions influence the type of offenses committed in Atlanta, GA?
  3. Does the Moon phase influence the volume or type of offenses in Atlanta, GA? Specifically the Full moon.
  4. Can we predict the rate of offenses committed in Atlanta, GA using a linear regression model?

From displayed graphs from datasets this is what we intrepreted. 
  1. Highest crime rate occurs between 71 ~ 80 degree fahrenheit.
    This is particularly notes when comparing different neighborhoods inside Atlanta. 
    Each negihborhood, even though total amount of crime count varies, it all has higher crime count between 71 ~ 80 degree fahrenheit.
  2. Lowest crime rate occurs below freezing temperature. 
  3. Highest crime rate occurs in smallest rain range, 0 ~ 0.19 inch precipitation. 
  4. Inside subjective definition of "Good" and "Bad" weather, trend of crime rate is similar in both weather condition,
      but total amount of crime across type of crime is always higher during "Good" weather.
  5. Moonphase did not affect significantly on total amount of crime that happened during each moonphase. 
     Full Moon phase did not differ greatly compared to other moon phase.
     
From these interpretation, we conclude following : 
  1. Temperature does seem to affect amount of crime occuring, especially between 71 ~ 80 degree fahrenheit range. 
  2. When precipitation is more than zero, crime rate decrease significantly in Atlanta. 
  3. Homicide increase 120% during "Bad" weather, but actual count increased from 10 to 22. 
  4. Moon phase does not affect volume or type of crime in Atlanta. 
  5. Other than linear regression model, other model of regression model would be more appropriate in interpreting data. 
    Most of data seems like exponential model, not linear model.
